# GSExtensions
This set of scripts is designed to fill in some gaps in Lua's and Figura's standard libraries.

Features such as `string.split` and `table.reverse` can be found as well as new libraries such as the `item_stack`
library used for handling item stacks.

View the [Wiki](../../wiki) for more information.

# Installation
Check out the wiki to see which extension you want to add, then click on the [scripts](./scripts) directory and select
the extension you want to add.  
Once you have the extension open, click the download button on the top right of the code view window. If the extension
needs GSE Common, make sure to download that as well.

# Usage
Assuming your avatar does not use `autoScripts`, the extensions will automatically apply to your workspace *eventually*.  
If you are not sure the extensions have fully loaded, it would be a good idea to `require` them first.
